# heart-attack-eda-and-model-building
This project focuses on exploring and predicting heart attacks using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and building predictive models. Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection can be critical in prevention and treatment.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors that may influence the likelihood of a heart attack. .

Goal
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the dataset through EDA to gain insights into the factors contributing to heart attacks. Additionally, predictive models will be developed to forecast the likelihood of a heart attack based on the provided features.

Contents
Data Exploration: Exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Transformation and creation of new features to enhance model performance.
Model Building: Development of machine learning models for heart attack prediction.
Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
Deployment: If applicable, deployment strategies for the predictive model.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization
Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or other machine learning libraries for model development
Jupyter Notebook or similar for code execution and documentation
